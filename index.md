## 📜 About Me  
Hi! I’m a Data Scientist who loves working with data 📊. I enjoy finding patterns, solving problems, and turning data into useful insights that help make better decisions.

I work mostly with Python, SQL, and machine learning, and I like creating tools that make data analysis easier and smarter 🤖. I’m always curious to learn new things and improve my skills, from data visualization to automation and AI.

What I love most about data science is that it combines logic, creativity, and real impact. Every dataset tells a story, and I enjoy discovering what’s behind the numbers 💡

When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me reading Stanisław Lem. His books inspire me to think about technology, intelligence, and the future 🚀
